	TO DO:
	    - On consensus, have an airhorn sound appear
	    - Get the game to appear in the right column (It's in $('.pointing-right-column'))
	    - They have jquery, so take advantage of that
	    - What if we added a control panel that would add/remove the styling as requested? Basically a selector that, upon selection,
	      would apply or remove whatever styling was set
